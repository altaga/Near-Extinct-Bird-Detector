# Introduction:

Because of illegal hunting and sporting hunt, there are several near-extinct bird species that could be saved with technological solutions.

The current discussion [1] according to Nature, is how much of this extinction of species can be mitigated if action is taken to avoid it, reinforced by Birdlife [2], and it approximates a 40% mitigation.

Similar solutions that i found are based on raising awareness of the problem. Ignoring those solutions, i can find:

* Use of necklaces with GPS.
Disadvantages: collars and sensors that go on an animal can cause damage or discomfort to the animal. In the case of batteries, they can explode.

* Smart sensing with Drones.
Disadvantages: They can generate unexpected collisions or collapses against animals and injure them.

* Identification of birdâ€™s songs.
Disadvantages: complex and cumbersome system which can be difficult to maintain for a long time in one place.

In the case of the latter, in addition to strengthening our theory, it gives us the opportunity to make an easily reproducible, energy efficient and powerful system.

# Solution:

Using the Infineon IM69D130 PDM digital microphone included in the QuickFeather Development Kit we will obtain an audio signal which, using SensiML, we can pass through a neural network, which indicates the type of bird we are hearing.
